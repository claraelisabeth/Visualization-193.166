## Task Description
The task is to implement a state-of-the-art interactive visualization technique in a group of two (you can use the group finder to find a partner!). There are three principle approaches how to address the project: 

- Select an article describing a state-of-the-art visualization algorithm (e.g., from our paper list). Implement the technique in a different programming language (e.g., using WebGPU instead of d3) or in a different environment (e.g., in virtual or augmented reality) than the reference solution from the paper. The focus lies on the quality (e.g., performance, visual result, usability) of the implemented algorithm compared to the reference paper. 
- Select a state-of-the-art visualization technique for which an open source implementation exists and adapt or extend it. Examples could be a generalization of the technique to other data types, increasing the scalability of the system, or adding new interaction techniques. The focus lies on the technical quality (e.g., performance, robustness against different data characteristics) and / or creativity of the implemented extension.  
- Select a challenging data set (e.g., large or complex) and visualize it using a state-of-the-art visualization technique (e.g., re-implementing one of our provided papers). The focus lies on a creative (interactive) solution and a robust system. 
It is up to you how you implement this exercise, no requirements on the programming language, libraries, or development environment are given. This could be an opportunity to try new technology!

## Further Information
Each project must include a README.md file in the submission repository. The README should explain:
- The goal of your project and which visualization technique you implemented.
- A summary of the re-implemented / extended algorithm / technique. 
- How to install and run your code (dependencies, setup instructions).
- A short usage guide (e.g., which parameters can be adjusted, how to interact with the system).
- References to the original paper(s) and other resources you used.
You may also include screenshots, small demo videos, or example data sets to showcase your results.

### Grading
Grading criteria of the final implementation: 
- Quality of the algorithm as implemented in the reference paper
- Visual result
- Feature-richness / interactivity (very basic implementation vs. many parameters to tune) 
- Generalizability (supports just one trivial data set vs. supports multiple data sets) 
- Performance
- Creativity concerning extensions of the selected technique
- Usability
The weighting of these aspects depends on the scope of the chosen project. 

Point deductions: 
- Exceptionally poor code quality (max. 5 points deduction) 
- Late submissions (-10% for every delayed day)
